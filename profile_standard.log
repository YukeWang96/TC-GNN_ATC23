    WRN   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          this device's fp32 peak performance and 0% of its fp64 peak performance. See the Kernel Profiling Guide

    WRN   The memory access pattern for global stores in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses   
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 8.0 sectors per request, or 8.0*32 = 256.0 bytes of cache data transfers per request.     
          The optimal thread address pattern for 4.0 byte accesses would result in 4.0*32 = 128.5 bytes of cache data   
          transfers per request, to maximize L1TEX cache performance.Check the Source Counters section for uncoalesced  
          global stores.

    WRN   The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 1.2 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters

    WRN   Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.5 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 12 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          11.12 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.56 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps   
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

    WRN   On average, each warp of this kernel spends 15.4 cycles being stalled waiting for sibling warps at a CTA      
          barrier. This represents about 54.8% of the total average of 28.1 cycles between issuing two instructions. A  
          high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that    
          causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible    
          try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to         
          identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that          
          synchronization point first.
